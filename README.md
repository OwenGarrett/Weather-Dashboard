# Weather-Dashboard

Thank you for taking the time to review my submission and for providing your invaluable feedback. I am very greatful for your detailed feedback as it helps me in the development process. I am very eager to learn! 

This is my second submission of this project. My favorite part of the app is the CSS styling. I enjoy it in the beginning because it helps me not only learn about all of the different elements that I'm working on for a particular project, but also it helps me keep them organized. Most importantly though; I like bright, loud colors. They are the best. Neon is life. 

In this Weather Dashboard application you will be able to

* Search by US city to find the current weather for that city
* See a detailed five day forecast for that city
* See in a list, the cities that you have previously searched in app

Thank you again for reviewing my submission.
